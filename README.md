# Fusion.io

Fusion was a project that focused on improving the efficiency of data structures and algorithms. The goal of the project was to design and implement a new data structure that could handle large amounts of data and perform operations quickly. To achieve this goal, I wanted conducted reseatch on various data structures and algorthims and evaluated their performance on different types of data sets. Based in this reseacrh, I developed a protype of the Fudion data structure rhat combined the strengths of serveral existing data structures in order ti achieve improved performance. I then implemented abd tested the Fusion data struture on a variety of data sets to measure its performance and effciency.The results showed tgat tge Fusion data struture was able to perform operations significantly faster than other data structures in certain cases. Overall, the Fusion project demmostrated my ability to conduct resarch, desgin and impleme net new data strutures, and evaluate the perfomance if different algothims. It is also highlighted my smkills in problem-solving abd critical thinking, as I had to carefully consider the trade-offs and limitations of different data structures and algorthims in order to develop a solution that wa sboth efficent an effective.
